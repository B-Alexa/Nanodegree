<h1>Important Concept Notes</h1>
<div>
	<h2>Lesson 1: The basics of the World Wide Web and HTML</h2>
	<div>
		<p><b>How the Web Works</b></p>
		<p>The web is made up of you, your computer and browser, the internet and servers. You use your browser to make requests via the internet to servers. The requests use a protocol called <b> HTTP </b>.</p>
		<p>The internet is the world's largest computer network. Servers are computers which host files.</p>
		<p> To learn more, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc"> THIS VIDEO</a> which describes how the internet works in a little more detail.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Intro to HTML</b></p>
		<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is made up of text content <em>(what you see)</em>, markup <em>(what it looks like)</em>, references to other documents <em>(i.e. images and videos)</em>, and links to other pages.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Why Computers Are "Stupid"</b></p>
		<p>Computers do exactly what they are told. As a result, a small mistake in code can cause large problems. </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>HTML Markup and Tags</b></p>
		<p>Some important tags to learn are</p> 
		<ul>
			<li>bold: &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;</li>
			<li>italics: &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Tags may have attributes. For example, the anchor tag which is used for making links has an attribute.</p>
		<p>Note: a void tag (such as &lt;br&gt;) does not have any content, therefore it does not need a closing tag </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Inline vs Block</b></p>
		<p>An <b>inline</b> element only takes up as much width as necessary and does not force line breaks.</p>
		<p>A <b>block</b> element is an element that takes up the full width available, and has a line break before and after it. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Lesson 2: Adding Structure to Your HTML Document</h2>
	<div>
		<p><b>Building a Website is like Building a House</b></p>
		<p>HTML files provide the structure (i.e. these describe where the walls are placed, which room is which, etc). CSS files add style. In the house analogy, CSS would describe wall color, carpeting, etc. Javascript provides the interactive components, which would be like the garage door opener or tv remote control. These change some element of your "house."</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>The "Tree-Like" Structure</b></p>
		<p>HTML classifies content in a "tree-like structure." HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes, etc.</p>
		<p>The Document Object Model, or <em>DOM</em>, is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the <em>DOM tree</em>.</p>
